# 💼 TechNova Project Management Dashboard – Power BI

## 📊 Overview
TechNova Solutions is a mid-sized technology consulting firm managing a wide range of IT projects across departments such as infrastructure, software development, and cybersecurity.

As the company expands, tracking project budgets, controlling costs, and evaluating performance has become increasingly complex. Despite having dedicated budgets and KPIs in place, TechNova has faced several challenges:
- Frequent cost overruns  
- Inconsistent performance reporting  
- Lack of real-time financial visibility  

This Power BI dashboard was developed to address these challenges by providing interactive, real-time insights into project financials, performance metrics, and overall portfolio health.
